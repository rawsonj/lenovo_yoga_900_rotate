# lenovo_yoga_900_rotate

Loosely based on [this gist from el-grad][1]

This is a near-complete rewrite of that person's script, because
I couldn't follow what they were doing and I thought it was a little bit
complicated and didn't need to be. It also didn't work for this laptop
at all so one thing lead to another...

## DISCLAIMER

I wrote this for me, and it works decently for me. I put it on github in the
hopes that another die-hard linux user may find it useful.

I add this script to my window manager's startup and keep it backgrounded.

The script is pretty dirt simple and in my testing doesn't consume much
system resources, so it can be run like a daemon.
